### Case 1 - Tax calculation service refactoring

**Situation**: Describe the situation and when it took place.

```
The existing tax calculation service contained a significant amount of legacy code, boilerplate, and was challenging to 
maintain and troubleshoot. It took a considerable amount of time to fix existing issues and introduce new functionality.
New team members required a significant amount of time to learn how to work with this service.
```

**Task**: Explain the task and what was the goal.

```
The task was to refactor the existing codebase, applying some optimizations without changing the overall semantics. 
The main goal was to simplify working with the service and reduce the time required for introducing new features and 
fixing existing bugs.
```

**Action**: Provide details about the action you took to attain this.

```
I discussed this issue with my team lead and proceeded with functional code decomposition. I identified duplicated code 
fragments and leveraged the modern API provided by the Java version we were using. Additionally, I utilized the 
capabilities offered by the Spring Framework.
```

**Result**: Conclude with the result of your action.

```
Working with the service was significantly simplified. Support tasks became feasible for the entire team without any 
specific training, eliminating the need for a single developer solely responsible for the service. Through fine-tuning
of the configuration, the average request processing time was reduced by approximately 10%.
```

### Case 2 - 'External tax integration' service moved to a separate gradle module

# Shift left

"Shift left" refers to the practice of moving certain activities or tasks earlier in the development process, typically
to detect and address issues earlier and improve overall efficiency and quality.

**Situation**:

```text
An organization may have frequent issues with identifying and fixing defects late in the software
development life cycle, causing delays and higher costs.
```

**Task**:

```text
In this case, the task would be to optimize the development process by implementing a "shift left" approach to
improve defect detection and resolution.
```

**Action**:

```text
Here are some possible actions that might have taken:

- Testing: introducing early testing practices, such as incorporating unit tests and automated testing frameworks,
  allows continuous testing throughout the development process, enabling quicker identification and resolution of
  defects.

- Code reviews: implementing a code review process where developers regularly review each other's code helps identify
  issues and promote coding best practices early, while reducing the chance of defects later.

- Collaboration: close collaboration between development and testing teams from the early stages involving regular
  meetings and discussions to address any concerns or questions, ensuring alignment and shared understanding of
  requirements and design.
```

**Result**:

```text
- Defect detection: with the implementation of "shift left" practices, defects were identified and addressed much
  earlier in the development process. This resulted in significant reductions in the number of defects discovered during
  later stages, leading to smoother and faster development cycles.

- Cost and time savings: by catching and resolving issues earlier, the organization experiencing cost and time
  savings.

- Quality improvement: The "shift left" practice contributing to improved software quality. By addressing issues
  earlier, the final products had fewer defects, resulting in higher customer satisfaction and reduced support and
  maintenance efforts.
